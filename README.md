# Python Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game built with Python and tkinter.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- The standard library `tkinter` module available (usually included with Python)

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   python snake.py
   ```

## How to Play

- On the start screen, press **Space** to begin.
- Control the snake with the **arrow keys**.
- Eat the red food squares to grow and increase your score.
- Avoid hitting the window borders.
- Avoid running into your own body.
- When you lose, **Game Over** is shown.
- Press **R** to restart after game over.

## Important File Name Warning

Do **not** place files named `random.py` or `tkinter.py` in this folder (or in the same directory where you run the game).  
Using these names can cause Python to import your local files instead of the standard library modules `random` and `tkinter`, which will break the game.
